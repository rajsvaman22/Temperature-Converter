When it comes to temperature conversion (often shortened to temp conversion), it is easy to convert Celsius to Kelvin, however, if you want to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, it becomes more tricky... Unless you use our temperature conversion tool!

With our tool, you can perform temperature unit conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius - or any other combination of temperature units you choose! There is no need for you to remember any temperature conversion formula, or perform any mathematical operations; just input the temperature in your preferred units and watch the result appear. And, if you want to use this time you have saved, you can read on to find out about temperature scales!

What is temperature?
It is always hard to come up with a good definition for everyday terms, but with temperature, it is notoriously difficult. We all know what is hot or cold, but temperature? Temperature is much harder to define without getting technical, which is precisely why we will get technical. To do this we have to turn to physics, in particular to thermodynamics and statistical physics, which is like thermodynamics meets quantum physics.

There is no need to worry, however, because when we dig deeper into what is temperature, the answer is fairly simple: temperature is speed or rather the momentum of the atoms and molecules that make up a material. What this means is that the higher the temperature of something, the higher the particles velocity; a.k.a.the molecules that make up that something vibrate faster. This is very closely related to the concept of thermal energy and means that heat is just another expression of kinetic energy.

As always, there's much more to these concepts than what we've mentioned here, like for example the fact that speed is related to the kinetic energy by means of a square root. Or the fact that when we mention speed we should technically speak of the average of all the speeds of all the particles... But this would, then, become a large essay on the physical concept of temperature, and there would not be space for a conversion tool.

Fortunately, we have the time and space to point out some interesting facts about temperature, like how any friction will end up creating heat, by converting kinetic energy from one source to another (and therefore increasing the temperature). It is also interesting to note that once we think of temperature as a form of energy it becomes fairly clear that our body burns more calories when we try to burn calories by running vigorously, which, incidentally creates much more heat inside our bodies than light exercise.

Thinking about temperature and heat in terms of energy is very useful and helps us understand many of the things that happen around us. Nevertheless, this is not the only thing we will talk about. Since this is a temperature conversion tool, it is only fair that we talk about units of temperature. We also need to acknowledge the different ways of measuring temperature. We're not talking only about different types of thermometers, but also about different scales.

Temperature and relation to other magnitudes
Everything is connected is something we hear a lot, but we barely consider to what extent this is true. In physics it is an unavoidable truth, one thing affects another; luckily for us, we know almost always how one thing affects another. We can also predict these changes, and use them to our advantage. We have already seen how a change in temperature involves a change in the momentum of the particles, but there are many more connections than just speed temperature.

Gas particles move as a consequence of non-zero temperature.

Just by looking at the weather, your intuition may already tell you that temperature and pressure are closely related. And if you're into your cycling numbers you probably also know that temperatures affect air density, and hence drag at a given speed. This is due to the thermal expansion of the gases in the air corresponding to an increase in volume. More volume translates to lower density since the weight remains constant.

This whole relationship between pressure, temperature, and volume is best explained by the ideal gas law equation, at least in a perfect world. By using this calculator together with the air density and drag equation calculators you could easily see how a change in temperature can significantly change the results of an experiment, such as a free fall with air resistance. This is easy to correct, but if you don't do it, you might end up with strange values for the gravitational force of the Earth. In this case, the problem would be due to the difference in buoyancy force resulting from the difference in air density.

All these relations between temperature and volume, pressure, or speed depend on the specific properties of the material you are dealing with. These properties are generally parametrized by physicists using quantities such as specific heat, latent heat, or thermal conductivity.

We will now talk about this temperature conversion calculator, how temperature is measured, and why we even need different units to measure temperature. Because, spoiler alert, having measurements in Celsius, and temperature in Fahrenheit or using Lord Kelvin's temperature scale is very useful, even if that means we need to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius to even understand each other.
